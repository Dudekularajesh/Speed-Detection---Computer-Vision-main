# Speed-Detection---Computer-Vision
# 🚗 Real-Time Vehicle Detection and Speed Estimation using YOLOv8

This project uses computer vision and deep learning to detect and track vehicles in real-time from video footage. It calculates the speed of each detected vehicle and flags those exceeding a speed threshold.

## 📸 Features

- Vehicle detection using YOLOv8 (`yolov8s.pt`)
- Real-time speed calculation using two virtual lines
- Detection of overspeeding vehicles
- Logging overspeeding vehicle IDs to a file
- Direction-based vehicle counting (up and down)

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- Pandas, NumPy
- Ultralytics YOLOv8
- Custom tracking module (`tracker.py`)

## 📂 File Structure

.
├── main.py # Main script for detection and speed calculation

├── tracker.py # Object tracking logic

├── coco.txt # COCO class names

├── over_speeding_cars_ID.txt # Output file for overspeeding vehicle IDs

├── stock-footage-traffic-on-the-indian-roads.WEBM # Input video


## 🚀 How to Run the Project

### 1. Clone the Repository

git clone https://github.com/Dudekularajesh/vehicle-speed-tracking-yolo.git

cd vehicle-speed-tracking-yolo

2. Install Dependencies

pip install opencv-python pandas numpy ultralytics
3. Place Required Files
Ensure coco.txt (COCO class names) is present.

Download and place the YOLOv8 weights file yolov8s.pt in the working directory.

Provide a traffic video named stock-footage-traffic-on-the-indian-roads.WEBM.

4. Run the Application

python main.py
5. Output
The app will open a window showing real-time detection.

It logs overspeeding vehicle IDs in over_speeding_cars_ID.txt.

📈 Parameters
Speed threshold: 40 km/h (hardcoded)

Frame skip: processes every 3rd frame for performance

Distance between virtual lines: 10 meters (simulated)

📌 Notes
Make sure your video shows traffic with vehicles moving across two horizontal lines.

You can adjust cy1 and cy2 in main.py to change the line positions.
